## What?

Content aggregators are a huge part of the web, delivering the latest news and acting as a social hub for communities like [reddit](http://reddit.com/), [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com),  [Designer News](http://news.layervault.com), and [Digg](http://digg.com/). While each of these has a different style and flavor of delivering the news, Fraction is being built with a few major differences:

* **You're in control.** Instead of showing you content that appeals to the lowest common denominator, your feed is personally tailored to show you content that's recommended by people who like the same things that you do.
* **Censorship is ██ing evil.** You should be able to decide what you see, not somebody else. [Computer crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_crime) is the only content that will be removed, and its removal will be completely open and transparent.
* **It's your data.** You can make the decision to download and delete all of your data whenever you'd like. If you ever feel that you can't trust Fraction with your personal data, you should be able to remove it immediately and permanently.

## When?
Fraction launches June 2nd, 2014 – although the [demo](http://demo.fraction.io) will always have the latest code for you to test. You can also [sign up for the launch email](http://eepurl.com/PS9SD) if you want to be emailed when it's released.

## Where?
There will be a [blog post every day](http://blog.fraction.io/), but you can also check out the [Fraction demo](http://demo.fraction.io/) if you want to see for yourself. The demo is bleeding-edge and highly experimental, but you can [open an issue](https://github.com/fraction/fraction/issues/new) if you run into anything unusual.

## Why?
1. People shouldn't have to do [shit work](http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/).
2. Content aggregators are prone to manipulation by people with money, authority, and bad intentions.
3. I want to use it.

## Who?
I'm [Christian Bundy](http://christianbundy.com), nice to meet you.
